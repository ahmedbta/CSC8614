Thanks for using Cursor in 2025!

We’ve created a personal summary of how you used Cursor this year: which models you used most, how many tab completions and agent messages, and how you compare with other power users.

See your Year in Code at cursor.com/2025 ( http://cursor.com/2025 ).

Cursor 2.3 is also being released now.

For this holiday release, we focused entirely on fixing bugs and improving stability across the agent, layout controls, code diffs, and more. These updates are rolling out gradually to ensure a smooth end-of-year coding experience.

Read about all changes at cursor.com/changelog/2-3 ( http://cursor.com/changelog/2-3 )

We’ll see you in 2026!
Best,
Cursor Team
