HOW TO BE THE
ANTI-COLD EMAILER OF 2026
*************************

Listen to Adam Goldfarb's episode of Outfoxed ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke89qDsgvbY&list=PLNc0nC3C2rRKsDEUg3BNDaNpgdnqBB5n6&utm_campaign=2025-12+Outfoxed%3A+Episode+five&utm_content=Adam+episode+%28community+plug%29&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )If you’re using cold email in 2026, the playbook is about to get simpler…and way less forgiving, and we're sharing how to succeed in episode 5 of Outfoxed with Adam Goldfarb.

In our last episode of 2025, Matt and I sat down with Adam, VP of Strategy and Operations & cold emailer, to unpack what tactics will actually work in 2026.

Adam's approach is against the grain, and you need to hear it,

This isn't a "make millions in pipeline" system; it is honest advice and a real playbook from someone in your shoes.

Volume, tools, and AI doing everything won’t save you. But this episode will give you the clarity you need to start 2026 right.
